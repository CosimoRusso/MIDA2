\paragraph{Conclusions} In case of black-box software sensing with non-linear systems the problem can be quite complex.
Using \emph{brute-force} approach (1 dynamic neural network) is usually doomed to failure.
The best is to gain some insight into the system and build some \emph{smart} regressors before black-box map.

\chapter{Gray-box System Identification}

We'll see two approaches
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using Kalman Filter
    \item Using Simulation error method
\end{itemize}

\section{Using Kalman Filter}
Kalman Filter is not a system identification method, it is a variable estimation approach (software-sensor, observer).
However we can use it also for gray-box system identification (\emph{side benefit} of K.F.).

\paragraph{Problem definition} We have a model, typically built as a white-box model using first principles:
\[
    S: \begin{cases}
        x(t+1) = f(x(t), u(t), \theta) + v_1(t) \\
        y(t) = h(x(t), \theta) + v_2(t)
    \end{cases}
\]

$f$ and $h$ are linear or non-linear functions, depending on some unknown parameter $\theta$ (with a physical meaning, e.g. mass, resistance, friction, \dots).

The problem is to estimate $\hat{\theta}$.

K.F. solves this problem by transforming the unknown parameters in extended states: K.F. makes the simultaneous estimation of $\hat{x}(t|t)$ (classic Kalman Filter problem) and $\hat{\theta}(t)$ (parameter identification problem).

\paragraph{Trick} State extension

\[
    S: \begin{cases}
        x(t+1) = f(x(t), u(t), \theta(t)) + v_1(t) \\
        \theta(t+1) = \theta(t) + v_\theta(t) \\
        y(t) = h(x(t), \theta(t)) + v_2(t)
    \end{cases}
\]

The new extended state vector is $x_E = \begin{bmatrix} x(t) \\ \theta(t) \end{bmatrix}$.
The unknown parameters are transformed in unknown variables.

The new equation we created
\[
    \theta(t+1) = \theta(t) + v_\theta(t)
\]
It is a \emph{fictitious} equation (not a physical equation).

The core dynamics is $\theta(t+1)=\theta(t)$, it's the equations of something which is constant.
This is exactly the nature of $\theta(t)$ which is indeed a constant vector of parameters.

We need a \emph{fictitious} noise in order to force Kalman Filter to find the right value of $\theta$ (if no noise in this equation K.F. probably would stay fixed on the initial condition).
We tell K.F. to do not rely on initial conditions.

Notice that this equation is not of an asymptotic stable system but a simply-stable system.
It's not a problem because K.F. can deal with non-asymptotically stable systems.

\paragraph{Design choice} The choice of the covariance matrix of $v_\theta(t) \sim WN(0, V_\theta)$.

We make the empirical assumption that $v_1 \perp v_\theta$ and $v_2 \perp v_\theta$ (there is no reason for $v_\theta$ to be correlated with $v_1$ and $v_2$).
\[
    V_\theta = \begin{bmatrix}
        \lambda_{1\theta}^2 & & & \\
        & \lambda_{2\theta}^2 & & \\
        & & \ddots & \\
        & & & \lambda_{n_\theta\theta}^2\\
    \end{bmatrix}
\]

It is a $n_\theta\times n_\theta$ and usually it is assumed that $\lambda_{1\theta}^2=\lambda_{2\theta}^2=\dots=\lambda_{n_\theta\theta}^2$.
We assume that $v_\theta(t)$ is a set of independent W.N. all with the same variance $\lambda_\theta^2$ (tuned empirically).

With a small value of $\lambda_\theta^2$ there is a slow convergence with small oscillations (noise) at steady-state (big trust to initial conditions).
With large values of $\lambda_\theta^2$ there's fast convergence but noisy at steady-state.

$\lambda_\theta^2$ is selected according to the best compromise for your specific application.

\paragraph{Notice} This trick can work in principle with any number of unknown parameters (e.g. 3 sensors, 10 states and 20 parameters).
In practice it works well only on a limited number of parameters (e.g. 3 sensors, 5 states and 2 parameters).

\begin{example}
    \missingfigure{Fig3}

    \begin{description}
        \item[Input] $F(t)$
        \item[Output] Position $x(t)$ (measured)
        \item[Parameters] $K$ and $M$ are known (measured), $c$ is unknown`
    \end{description}

    \missingfigure{Fig4}

    \paragraph{Problem} Estimate $c$ with a K.F.

    Using K.F. we do not need a training dataset.

    \paragraph{Step 1} Model the system
    \[
        \ddot{x}M = -Kx - c\dot{x} + F
    \]
    It's a differential, continuous time linear equation.
    It's second order so we need 2 state variables: $x_1(t) = x(t)$ and $x_2(t) = \dot{x}(t)$.
    \[
        \begin{cases}
            \dot{x}(t) = x_2(t) \\
            M\dot{x}_2(t) = -Kx_1(t) -cx_2(t) + F(t) \\
            y(t) = x_1(t)
        \end{cases}
        \begin{cases}
            \dot{x}_1(t) = x_2(t) \\
            \dot{x}_2(t) = -\frac{K}{M} x_1(t) - \frac{c}{M} x_2(t) + \frac{1}{M}F(t) \\
            y(t) = x_1(t)
        \end{cases}
    \]

    \paragraph{Step 2} Discretization

    Eulero forward: $\dot{x}(t) \approx \frac{x(t+1)-x(t)}{\Delta}$.

    \[
        \begin{cases}
            \frac{x_1(t+1)-x_1(t)}{\Delta} &= x_2(t) \\
            \frac{x_2(t+1)-x_2(t)}{\Delta} &= -\frac{K}{M} x_1(t) - \frac{c}{M} x_2(t) + \frac{1}{M}F(t) \\
            y(t) &= x_1(t)
        \end{cases}
    \]
    \[
        \begin{cases}
            x_1(t+1) = x_1(t) + \Delta x_2(t) \\
            x_2(t+1) = -\frac{K\Delta}{M}x_1(t) + \left(1-\frac{c\Delta}{M}\right)x_2(t) + \frac{\Delta}{M}F(t) \\
            y(t) = x_1(t)
        \end{cases}
    \]

    \paragraph{Step 3} State extension
    \[
        x_3(t+1) = x_3(t)
    \]
    \[
        \begin{cases}
            x_1(t+1) = x_1(t) + \Delta x_2(t) + v_{11}(t) \\
            x_2(t+1) = -\frac{K\Delta}{M}x_1(t) + \left(1-\frac{\Delta {\color{red}x_3(t)}}{M}\right)x_2(t) + \frac{\Delta}{M}F(t) + v_{12}(t) \\
            {\color{red}x_3(t+1) = x_3(t) + v_{13}(t)} \\
            y(t) = x_1(t) + v_2(t)
        \end{cases}
    \]

    The system is ready for K.F. application: we get at the same time $\hat{x}(t)$ and $\hat{c}(t)$.

    Notice that we need Extended Kalman Filter: even if the original system was linear, state extension moved to a non-linear system.
\end{example}
